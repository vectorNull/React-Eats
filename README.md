## About The App
React-Eats is an app that I wanted to put together to refresh my fundamental React skills. Although it may be a fairly simple looking UI, I am taking the time to revisit those building blocks that make a React app excellent. Several enigineers that I know have said that the difference between a good engineer and a excellent engineer is that the later took the time to really understand how things work, how they are put together, and drilled down on the fundamentals. They don't just copy/paste code, make a few changes and keep trying until it works. They take the time to really understand the relatively simple parts and put together something organized, clean, scalable, and efficient.
